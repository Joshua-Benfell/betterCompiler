# A better G++ compiler
A compiler that tells you if your code compiled with sound

To make this work:
* Ensure you are on a linux system
* Ensure g++ and mpg123 are installed
* Change any file paths in "compiler.cc" to match your setup (SOUND_PATH)
* Place the folder in a desired directory and compile the "compiler.cc" file
* Create an alias to the now compiled file for ease of use anywhere
* You can now use your better g++
