# A better G++ compiler
A compiler that tells you if your code compiled with sound

To make this work:
*Ensure you are on a linux system
*Ensure g++ and mpg123 are installed
*Change any file paths in "compiler.cc" to match your setup (SOUND_PATH)
*Place the folder in a desired directory and compile the "compiler.cc" file
*Create an alias to the now compiled file for ease of use anywhere
*You can now use your better g++
